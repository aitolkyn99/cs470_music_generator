to say about the things that you do
youre telling all those lies
about the good things that we can have
if we close our eyes
do what you want to do
and go where youre going to
think for yourself

the ruins of the life that you have in mind

i know your minds made up
youre gonna cause more misery
do what you want to do
and go where youre going to
think for yourself
cause i wont be there with you
although your minds opaque
try thinking more if just for your own sake
the future still looks good
and youve got time to rectify
all the things that you should
do what you want to do
and go where youre going to
think for yourself
cause i wont be there with you
do what you want to do
and go where youre going to
think for yourself
cause i wont be there with you

you didnt even think of me as someone with a name
did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
tell me why
what goes on in your heart
what goes on in your mind
you are tearing me apart
when you treat me so unkind
what goes on in your mind

but of all these friends and lovers
there is no one compares with you
and these memories lose their meaning
when i think of love as something new

for people and things that went before

in my life i love you more

for people and things that went before

when i get near you
the games begin to drag me down

every single day of my life
turn off your mind relax and float downstream
it is not dying it is not dying
lay down all thoughts surrender to the void
it is shining it is shining
that you may see the meaning of within
it is being it is being
that love is all and love is everyone
it is knowing it is knowing
that ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
it is believing it is believing
but listen to the colour of your dreams
it is not living it is not living
or play the game existence to the end
of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning of the beginning
of the beginning

follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies

waiting to take you away
climb in the back with your head in the clouds
and youre gone
lucy in the sky with diamonds

im filling the cracks that ran through the door
and kept my mind from wandering
where it will go
and it really doesnt matter if im wrong im right

wednesday morning at five oclock as the day begins
silently closing her bedroom door
leaving the note that she hoped would say more
she goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
quietly turning the backdoor key
stepping outside she is free
she we gave her most of our lives
is leaving sacrificed most of our lives
home 
we gave her everything money could buy

shes leaving home after living alone byebye
for so many years
father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
picks up the letter thats lying there
standing alone at the top of the stairs
she breaks down and cries to her husband daddy our babys gone
why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
how could she do this to me
she we never thought of ourselves
is leaving never a thought for ourselves
home we struggled hard all our lives to get by
shes leaving home after living alone byebye
for so many years
friday morning at nine oclock she is far away
waiting to keep the appointment she made
meeting a man from the motor trade
she what did we do that was wrong
is having we didnt know it was wrong
fun fun is the one thing that money cant buy
something inside that was always denied byebye
for so many years
shes leaving home byebye
for the benefit of mr kite
there will be a show tonight on trampoline
the hendersons will all be there
late of pablo fanques fair what a scene
over men and horses hoops and garters
lastly through a hogshead of real fire
in his way mr k will challenge the world
the celebrated mr k
performs his feat on saturday at bishopsgate
the hendersons will dance and sing
as mr kite flies through the ring dont be late
messrs k and h assure the public
their production will be second to none
and of course henry the horse dances the waltz
the band begins at ten to six
when mr k performs his tricks without a sound
and mr h will demonstrate
ten somersets hell undertake on solid ground
having been some days in preparation
a splendid time is guaranteed for all
and tonight mr kite is topping the bill
we were talking about the space between us all
and the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
never glimpse the truth then its far too late when they pass away
we were talking about the love we all could share
when we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
with our love we could save the world if they only knew
try to realise its all within yourself
no one else can make you change
and to see youre really only very small
and life flows on within you and without you
we were talking about the love thats gone so cold
and the people who gain the world and lose their soul
they dont know they cant see are you one of them
when youve seen beyond yourself then you may find
peace of mind is waiting there
and the time will come when you see were all one
and life flows on within you and without you
when i get older losing my hair
many years from now
will you still be sending me a valentine
birthday greetings bottle of wine
if id been out till quarter to three
would you lock the door
will you still need me will you still feed me
when im sixtyfour
youll be older too
and if you say the word
i could stay with you
i could be handy mending a fuse
when your lights have gone
you can knit a sweater by the fireside
sunday mornings go for a ride
doing the garden digging the weeds
who could ask for more
will you still need me will you still feed me
when im sixtyfour
every summer we can rent a cottage
in the isle of wight if its not too dear
we shall scrimp and save

in their sties with all their backing
they dont care what goes on around
in their life theres something lacking
what they needs a damn good whacking
everywhere theres lots of piggies living piggy lives
you can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
one more time
now somewhere in the black mining hills of dakota
there lived a young boy named rocky raccoon
and one day his woman ran off with another guy
hit young rocky in the eye
rocky didnt like that
he said im gonna get that boy
so one day he walked into town
booked himself a room in the local saloon
and rocky raccoon checked into his room
only to find gideons bible
but rocky had come equipped with a gun
to shoot off the legs of his rival
his rival it seems had broken his dreams
by stealing the girl of his fancy
her name was magill and she called herself lil
but everyone knew her as nancy
now she and her man who called himself dan
were in the next room at the hoedown
and rocky burst in and grinning a grin
he said danny boy this is a showdown
but daniel was hot he drew first and shot
and rocky collapsed in the corner
now the doctor came in stinking of gin
and proceeded to lie on the table
he said rocky you met your match
and rocky said doc its only a scratch
and ill be better ill be better doc as soon as i am able
and now rocky raccoon he fell back in his room
only to find gideons bible
gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
to help with good rockys revival
cmon rocky boy

day after day
alone on a hill
the man with the foolish grin
is keeping perfectly still
but nobody wants to know him
they can see that hes just a fool
and he never gives an answer
but the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
and the eyes in his head
see the world spinning round
well on the way
head in a cloud
the man of a thousand voices
talking perfectly loud
but nobody ever hears him
or the sound he appears to make
and he never seems to notice
but the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
and the eyes in his head
see the world spinning round
and nobody seems to like him
they can tell what he wants to do
and he never shows his feelings
but the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
and the eyes in his head
see the world spinning round oh oh oh round round round round
he never listens to them
he knows that theyre the fools
they dont like him
the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down
and the eyes in his head
see the world spinning round

in penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
of every head hes had the pleasure to know
and all the people that come and go
stop and say hello
on the corner is a banker with a motorcar
the little children laugh at him behind his back
and the banker never wears a mac
in the pouring rain
very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit and meanwhile back
in penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
he likes to keep his fire engine clean
its a clean machine
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
four of fish and finger pies
in summer meanwhile back
behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
a pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
and though she feels as if shes in a play
she is anyway
in penny lane the barber shaves another customer
we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
and then the fireman rushes in
from the pouring rain
very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit and meanwhile back
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
penny lane

some kind of innocence is measured out in years
you dont know what its like to listen to your fears
you can talk to me
you can talk to me

if youre lonely you can talk to me

item  scp
object class keter
special containment procedures when not being used scp is to be kept within a typical electronic digit metal safe in the safe wing of site  all digital and wireless broadcast media must be kept at least one hundred meters away from scp due to scps anomalous effect having been determined to have no ranged limit digital wireless and broadcast media may be used but should be monitored closely for any appearance of scp or 
other than the testing and recording of track  scp should be considered an inanimate item without agency of its own and any demands or threats made by scp should be ignored
once a week  is to be cleaned and all tracks are to be played in succession with special attention paid to the instance of  that replaces track 
the names situations and anecdotes presented in that instance of scp must then be reported to  special committee pac watch
on the rare occasion that nonfoundation organizations cannot address the situation presented in an instance of scp o has given authorization to activate mtf the suge knights to take any and all measures necessary to reach a resolution to the problem operational success will be indicated by a new instance of 
personnel who wish to examine or attempt to interact with scp must ask dr kivowitz for authorization beforehand which will then pend o clearance
description scp is a single compact disc copy of me against the world a hiphop album by the artist tupac shakur released in  physical examination as well as laser testing indicates that the cd was one of the initial release manufactured and distributed in  conventional testing of the disk itself reveals identical results to a nonanomalous copy of the album the case and liner notes have been determined to have no anomalous qualities and the physical makeup and encoding of the disk appear completely normal
however upon playing track  normally heavy in the game the listener will encounter an instance of scp the anomaly takes the form of spontaneouslygenerated professionallyproduced songs featuring tupac shakur in various styles within the hip hop genre though each instance of scp generated is unique they share certain commonalities in terms of subject matter the central focus of the song invariably addresses a crime almost always a murder or series of murders and then gives necessary anecdotal evidence or information to correctly identify and prosecute the killer even going so far as to specify prosecutors or recommend vigilante justice
though generation of scp has been determined to have a definite causal nature the manner in which scp instances are copied onto scp has yet to be ascertained
scp
the primary voice on the songs from herein identified as scp matches cleanly through advanced audio analysis to that of the real tupac shakur who died in  over a year before the recovery of scp
however occasionally on crimes of a particularly complicated or brutal nature scp will be joined by other performers either guestrapping or singing the chorus or bridge this has included many of tupacs contemporaries such as snoop doggy dogg nas no doubt everclear weezer and busta rhymes as well as artists from the s including chris brown katy perry lil wayne lady gaga rihanna the ying yang twins drake neon trees jet jayz kanye west and eminem usually at the height of their popularity
on a few notable occasions involving longunsolved crimes by still active criminals there have been guests of a more blatantly anachronistic nature standouts among whom include phil harris the andrews sisters frank sinatra buddy holly the who elvis presley diana ross and the beatles heavily anachronistic guests tend to take the role of primary artist the song performed in their style with scp joining as a rap guest
when contacted none of these artists had any recollection of recording for or information regarding scp
the crimes themselves share that they are unsolved or in some cases have escaped detection entirely the majority of instances of scp address crimes of private citizens such as serial killers spreemurders or career criminals though occasionally the songs will address larger groups such as hamas isis the ira and even in two separate instances the chaos insurgency and the church of the broken god
a prototypical example of scp is included here for reference

jeff riegert out there and still stalkin the night
killed his brother and five strangers with the same damn knife
now its not my place to tell you what to do
but nigga i know what i would do if i were you
he hid the blade in an old barn off the north 
he already got six dog dont let him make it seven
when the crimes have been addressed and the guilty parties brought to light either by the legal system or otherwise scp is immediately replaced by a new instance however the track is easily recorded through conventional means recorded versions are not subject to change or replacement and the original can be replayed from the cd endlessly before the killer is found with no little variation there are currently nearly one thousand instances of scp on record

scp was recovered in the home of avon lincoln arrested for the vigilante slaying of michael ferris who was later revealed to have been the ojai strangler responsible for six murders over the summer of 
avons insistence that tupac shakur spoke to him from beyond the grave and told him he had to take justice into his own hands because ferris position as district attorney would prevent a fair trial drew the attention of foundation agents after the song in question was produced as evidence in court
amnestics were administered to all involved and lincoln was released back into the general population
addendum a the xk incident
initially researchers experimented with anonymously tipping off local police departments through foundation plants which led to the resolution of over  cold cases including the recovery of scp scp and scp though no direct link has been established other than the murders involved
however after  years this use of the scp was deemed impractical repeatedly addressing the crimes discussed in s music was in practice allowing the scp to dictate the circumstances of its containment and under the wrong circumstances opened the foundation to potential exposure through continuous interaction with law enforcement at all levels across multiple governments
in response to this o ceased addressing the crimes in late 
after two months passed scps behavior radically changed when for the first time an instance of scp was produced that revealed scp had an awareness of its containment

you say youre about security but you aint the good guys
you redact and expunge man your silence is lies
you say youre here to protect yet youre letting killers run free
dont make me show you how rough this thug can be
well
you cant contain the king dawg
homie you do not wanna start this struggle
i suggest you change the tune unless youre looking for trouble
maybe yall should lay back and let me do my duty
locked in drawer feelin like yall tryna screw me
youre steppin all up on my destiny
you might not believe im the real pac
but im not just a cd
the decision was made to halt testing entirely rather than acquiesce
after one week passed an instance of scp appeared spontaneously on the youtube channel of los angelesbased hip hop station  and in the lone hour before it was taken down accrued over  views
xk scenario incident
the image displayed on the video was a still photograph apparently authentic though by its nature highly anomalous the photograph is of shakur estimated to be in his early forties wearing the garb of foundation dclass personnel with his middle fingers raised the accompanying song titled   focused on scp revealing its actual location and means by which it could be broken free of current containment procedures and identified several members of the o council by their first names as it described the function and nature of the foundation
in a massive sweeping operation involving the activation of multiple task forces across  continents all trace of the video was erased and all  viewers were administered classa amnestics midway through this operation an entire album titled xk scenario was released to the itunes account of beyonce knowles each song featured scp as well as a variety of guest artists and focused on a different keter class scp currently in captivity
though scp tracking bots were able to bring xk scenario down after only  downloads complete digital eradication of the individual files has proven difficult though no loss of life or property was incurred the sheer scale of the danger posed by this containment breach prompted a foundationwide state of high alert this prompted an ongoing upgrade to all automatic scp firewalls and engendered the reclassification of scp from euclid to keter
the breach sparked heated debate as to how to proceed with the containment of and conceptual understanding regarding scp which came to an end upon the appearance of a new instance of scp this instance was produced spontaneously through the mouth of scp which appeared to fall into a trance state during the incident with the lyrics in totality repeatedly written in what was identified as  one hundred and seventeen thousand  times all over the interior of its containment chamber

help me catch my killers
and ill let you have yours
trust me you nerds do not want a war
what if i told you i      it all

you dont want to deal with the real me
i can hear you right thinkin of a fucking plan
you cant stop me im the fucking man
so consider long and hard the hammer im swingin
cause the next time you open your mouth
it might just be me singin
the decision was made to resume the former method of testing involving the embedded informants used to relay scps evidence and information while continuing to study the method by which scp transmits its broadcasts in an effort to truly contain it completely scp resumed its previous behavioral pattern scps focusing on crimes until their killers are located by conventional law enforcement with the exception of one final track  at this time its last recorded direct interaction with the foundation

step in the ring with a god and youre gonna get clowned
but lets be real homie there was no need to fight it
theres a grander design and i betcha gonna like it
you got a lot of gray
and that keeps you up at night
but sometimes
things really are just black and white
investigation into any kind of link or pattern between the crimes scp solves is ongoing as is interest to why it doesnt use its agency to pursue the criminals in question rather than working through proxies

a friend says that your love wont mean a lot
and you know that your love is all youve got
at times things are so fine and at times theyre not
but when she says she loves you that means a lot
a friend says that a love is never true
but you know this cant apply to you
a touch can mean so much when its all youve got
and when she says she loves you that means a lot
love can be deep inside
love can be suicide
cant you see you cant hide what you feel
when its real
a friend says that your love wont mean a lot
but you know that your love is all youve got
a touch can mean so much when its all youve got
but when she says she loves you that means a lot

sunrise doesnt last all morning
a cloudburst doesnt last all day
seems my love is up
and has left you with no warning
but its not always going to be this grey
all things must pass
all things must pass away
sunset doesnt last all evening
a mind can blow those clouds away
after all this my love is up
and must be leaving
it has not always been this grey
all things must pass
none of lifes strings can last
so i must be on my way
and face another day
now the darkness only stays at nighttime
in the morning it will fade away
daylight is good
at arriving at the right time
its not always going to be this grey

in the town where i was born
lived a man who sailed to sea
and he told us of his life
in the land of submarines
so we sailed on to the sun
till we found the sea of green
and we lived beneath the waves
in our yellow submarine
we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine yellow submarine
we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine yellow submarine
and our friends are all aboard
many more of them live next door
and the band begins to play

in penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
of every head hes had the pleasure to know
and all the people that come and go
stop and say hello
on the corner is a banker with a motorcar
the little children laugh at him behind his back
and the banker never wears a mac
in the pouring rain
very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit and meanwhile back
in penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen
he likes to keep his fire engine clean
its a clean machine
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
four of fish and finger pies
in summer meanwhile back
behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
a pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
and though she feels as if shes in a play
she is anyway
in penny lane the barber shaves another customer
we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
and then the fireman rushes in
from the pouring rain
very strange
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit and meanwhile back
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
penny lane

sit you down father rest you
lady madonna children at your feet
wonder how you manage to make ends meet
who finds the money when you pay the rent
did you think that money was heaven sent
friday night arrives without a suitcase
sunday morning creeping like a nun
mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace
see how they run
lady madonna baby at your breast
wonders how you manage to feed the rest
see how they run
lady madonna lying on the bed
listen to the music playing in your head
tuesday afternoon is never ending
wednesday morning papers didnt come
thursday night your stockings needed mending
see how they run
lady madonna children at your feet
wonder how you manage to make ends meet
without going out of my door
i can know all things on earth
without looking out of my window
i could know the ways of heaven
the farther one travels
the less one knows
the less one really knows
without going out of your door
you can know all things on earth
without looking out of your window
you could know the ways of heaven
the farther one travels
the less one knows
the less one really knows
arrive without travelling
see all without looking
do all without doing
