Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (
Woo
)
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (
Woo
)
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

(She's got the devil in her heart)
But her eyes, they tantalize
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me
I'll take my chances, for romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
(She's got the devil in her heart)
No, no, this I can't believe
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
No, no, nay will she deceive
I can't believe that she'll ever, ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?

Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
You know you made me cry

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah!
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Ah!
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling  you holding me tight
Tight, yeah!
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're going to say you love me too
You love me too, you love me too
You love me too
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too

I've discovered I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me, oh, so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Well I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love
I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no!
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Ow!
Buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no!
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there
If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right
If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathize
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there
If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There's nothing I won't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight, and I'll come to you
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-hey
But I'll come back again someday
And when I do you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-hey
But I'll come back again someday
And when I do you better hide all the girls
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today
You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
Come on, on my way
'Cause I'm-a going to see my baby today
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say to her
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
Come on if you please
I've got no time for trivialities
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
When I'm getting home tonight
I'm going to hold her tight
I'm going to love her till the cows come home
I bet I'll love her more
Till I walk out that door
Again
Come on, let me through
I've got so many things I've got to do
I've got no business being here with you
This way
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home
I’ve got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I’m going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that
Well, it’s the second time I’ve caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!
You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
If I were you, I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no reply
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Mr. Moonlight
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine
I think you're fine
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight, come again please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I'll pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight
And the night you don't come my way
Oh, I'll pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight

Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling, when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
Well how come you say you will when you won't
Say you do, baby, when you don't?
Let me know honey how you feel
Tell the truth now, is love real?
But ah ah well honey don't, well honey don't
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't
Well I love you, baby, and you ought to know

Everything about you is so doggone sweet
You got that sand all over your feet
But ah ah well honey don't, honey don't
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't
(Ahh rock on George, one time for me!
I feel fine, mmmhm. I said...)
Well sometimes I love you on a Saturday night
Sunday morning you don't look right
You've been out painting the town
Ah ah baby, been stepping around
But ah ah well honey don't, I said honey don't
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't
(Ah rock on George, for Ringo one time! Woo!)
Well honey don't, well honey don't
Uh little, little honey don't
I say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't
When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oooh
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me now
There is one thing I'm sure of
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oooh
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oooh
Every little thing
Every little thing
I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know
I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her
I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her
Though I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me?
Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby, now
Woke up last night, half past four
Fifty women knocking on my door
Everybody's trying to be my baby
Everybody's trying to be my baby

Before I got home I had nineteen dates
Everybody's trying to be my baby

(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
When I was younger, so much younger than today

And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Help me? Help me? Ooh
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me
Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this, I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
I need you
I need you

The girl that's driving me mad is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care
She said that living with me is bringing her down, yeah
She would never be free when I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care
I don't know why she's riding so high
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice, she ought to do right by me
I think I'm going to be sad, I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad is going away, yeah
Oh, she's got a ticket to ride

They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you
Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
If you let me take your heart I will prove to you
We will never be apart if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Hmm
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-m'mmm-mmm
Had it been another day I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Di-di-di-di'n'di
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
I have never known the like of this I've been alone
And I have missed things and kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite like this
Da-da-n'da-da'n'da
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
I've just seen a face I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met, she's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
Fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
Oh, fallin', yes I am fallin'
And she keeps callin' me back again
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-hmm
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When we do the stroll
Come on, Miss Lizzy
Love me before I grow too old
Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Oh girl, you look so fine
Just a-rocking and a-rolling
Girl I said I wish you were mine
Aw!
Aw!
Woo!
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you call my name
Oooh baby
Say you're driving me insane
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
I want to be your loving man
Ooh
Ooh
Aw!
Run and tell your mama
I want you to be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby, don't run and hide
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
Girl, I want to marry you
Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rocking and a-rolling
Oh I said I wish you were mine
Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said baby, it's understood
Working for peanuts is all very fine
But I can show you a better time
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah!
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
I told that girl I can start right away
When she said listen, babe, I got something to say
I got no car and it's breakin' my heart
But I've found a driver and that's a start
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?
When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have heard enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)
I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away
And you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me (you won't see me)
You won't see me (you won't see me)
Ooooh oh la la-la
Ooooh oh la la-la
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man can you see me at all?
Nowhere man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Say the word, love
Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble
I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you
I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do I'm telling you so you'll understand
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble
Très bien ensemble
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
The other day I saw you as I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you, I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of no one else but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
[Bridge: John Lennon, 
Paul McCartney & George Harrison
]
She's the kind of girl who puts you down
(
Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit
)
When friends are there, you feel a fool
(
Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit
)
(
Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit
)
When you say she's looking good
(
Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit
)
She acts as if it's understood
(
Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit
)
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh
(
Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit
)
Girl
Girl, girl
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Yeah, oh, baby, you've changed
Ah, I'm looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You changed, you changed, you changed, you changed
There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
In my life, I love you more
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
I feel as though you ought to know
That I've been good, as good as I can be
And if you do, I'll trust in you
And know that you will wait for me
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away
And if your heart's strong, hold on, I won't delay
Wait till I come back to your side
We'll forget the tears we've cried
It's been a long time, now I'm coming back home
I've been away now, oh, how I've been alone
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
One, two, three, four
One, two...  (One, two, three, four)
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
If you drive a car, car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, walk, I'll tax your feet
Taxman
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Don't ask me what I want it for
(Haha, Mr. Wilson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Haha, Mr. Heath)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman!)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman!)
Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me (Taxman!)
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream (Float up stream)
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need (There's no need)
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins you'll see
I'll make love to you
If you want me to
To lead a better life I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our 
yellow
 submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Full steam ahead Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!
[Verse 4: Ringo Starr & 
Paul McCartney
]
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us (
Everyone of us
) has all we need (
Has all we need
)
Sky of blue (
Sky of blue
) and sea of green (
Sea of green
)
In our yellow (
In our yellow
) submarine (
Submarine, ha-ha!
)
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like I've never been born
I said, "who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born"
She said, "you don't understand what I've said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"
She said, "you don't understand what I said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"
She said, "I know what it's like to be dead
I know what it is to be sad
I know what it's like to be dead"
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
I need to laugh, and when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good, in a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
We take a walk, the sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
And then we lie, beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me
You say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me

Dr. Robert
Ring my friend I said you'd call Doctor Robert
Day or night he'll be there anytime at all, Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert, you're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can, Doctor Robert
If you are down he'll pick you up, Doctor Robert
Take a drink from his special cup, Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert, he's a man you must believe
Helping anyone in need
No one can succeed like Doctor Robert
Well, well, well you're feeling fine
Well, well, well he'll make you, Doctor Robert
My friend works for the National Health, Doctor Robert
Don't pay money just to see yourself with Doctor Robert
Doctor Robert, you're a new and better man
He helps you to understand
He does everything he can, Bob Robert
Well, well, well you're feeling fine
Well, well, well he'll make you, Doctor Robert
Ring my friend I said you'd call Doctor Robert
Ring my friend I said you'd call Bob Robert

I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
I've got time
I've got time
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning
Billy Shears!
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (Ah-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool, you fool)
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Fool, you fool)
I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
Getting so much better all the time!
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (
We gave her everything money could buy
)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)
For so many years
She's leaving home (Bye-bye)
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Whoo!
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)
Rita!
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you
Lovely Rita meter maid (Lovely meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Oh Lovely Rita, meter meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good...
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut (Ja! Ja!)
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut (Ja!)
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, gut (Gewözei teuer)
Guten Morgen, guten Morgen, good morning
I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
*Alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I read the news today—oh, boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way, the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.S.R. (yeah)
Been away so long, I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S
Back in the U.S.S.R
Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Oh, come on!
Yeah, I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R
Well, the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mind
Oh show me round your snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the U.S.S.R. (hey)
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R
Oh, let me tell you, honey
Hey, I'm back, I'm back in the U.S.S.R
Hey, it's so good to be home
Yeah, back in the U.S.S.R

I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows
Looking through the bent back tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion
Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store (Chu chu chu)
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (Ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her, she begins to sing (Sing)
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah

With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (Arm, leg)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band (Yes!)

Honey pie
Honey pie
Honey pie
Honey pie
Honey pie
Honey pie
Honey pie
Honey pie
I love you, honey pie
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
(I look) Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies, life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their life, there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking!
Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
One more time
Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"
And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
C'mon, Rocky boy
C'mon, Rocky boy
I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?
I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Who knows how long I've loved you
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will
For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know, I will
I will
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia
Julia, Julia
Ocean child calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes
Windy smile calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering in the sun
Julia, Julia
Morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia
Julia, sleeping sand
Silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Hmm hmm hmm
Calls me
So I sing a song of love for Julia
Julia, Julia

Two, three...
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
Yes, I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why
In the morning
Want to die
In the evening
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Want to die
Yeah, want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long, I'm sitting singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun
Mother Nature's son
Sexy Sadie, what have you done?
You made a fool of everyone
You made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you done?
Sexy Sadie, you broke the rules
You laid it down for all to see
You laid it down for all to see
Sexy Sadie, oh, you broke the rules
One sunny day, the world was waiting for a lover (Sexy Sadie)
She came along to turn on everyone
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them all (Sexy Sadie, she's the greatest)
Sexy Sadie, how did you know?
The world was waiting just for you
The world was waiting just for you
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you know?
Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are
However big you think you are
Sexy Sadie, oh, you'll get yours yet
We gave her everything we owned just to sit at her table
(Sexy Sadie)
Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all
Ooh woo
She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are

When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
'Til I get to the bottom, and I see you again!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Well, do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, tell me the answer!
Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer
Now, Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Yeah
Woo!
Oh, will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer!
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer
Look out!
Helter skelter

Coming down fast
Oh, yeah, Helter Skelter
Wooh!
I got blisters on my fingers!
It's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you?
It took a long, long, long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
How I love you
So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh, oh
Now I can see you, be you
How can I ever misplace you?
How I want you
Oh, I love you
You know that I need you
Oh, I love you

Take two
Okay
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all wanna change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out, in
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures
of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all right, all right

She was a working girl North of England way
Now she's hit the big time in the U.S.A
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say
Honey Pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Oh, honey pie, my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song
You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee
Oh, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me
Ooh, yeah
I like it like that, oh ah
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, Hollywood blues
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?
Tee, tee, tee
Now Honey Pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Ooh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Honey Pie, Honey Pie
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's Good News
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down the blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?
Creme tangerine and Montelimar

Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out

Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
Cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
Can you take me back where I came from
Can you take me back
Can you take me back where I came from
Brother, can you take me back
Can you take me back
Mm, can you take me where I came from
Can you take me back

...bottle of claret for you if I'd realised. I'd forgotten all about it George, I'm sorry
Well do next time
Will you forgive me?

Cheeky bitch
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen time your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for
Number 9, number 9
Who's to know?
Who was to know?
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
Right!
Right!
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have brought this specimen
I have nobody's short-cuts, aha
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
With the situation
They are standing still
Upon the telegram
Ooh ooh
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
Ooh
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low
Alright!
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea
Block that kick, block that kick!
In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling
Um da
Aaah
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming
Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building
Onion soup
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
Industrial output
Financial imbalance
Thrusting it between his shoulder blades
The Watusi
The Twist
El Dorado
Take this brother, may it serve you well
Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh
Maybe even then
Exposure could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked
If you become naked
Hold that line, hold that line!
Block that kick, block that kick!
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)
Mmm
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)
Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody, everywhere
Good night
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our 
yellow
 submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Full steam ahead Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!
[Verse 4: Ringo Starr & 
Paul McCartney
]
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us (
Everyone of us
) has all we need (
Has all we need
)
Sky of blue (
Sky of blue
) and sea of green (
Sea of green
)
In our yellow (
In our yellow
) submarine (
Submarine, ha-ha!
)
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one there
One, two, three, four
Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, I love you
A, B, C, D
Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J, I love you

Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?
Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
[Verse 3: John Lennon, Paul McCartney &

Yeah

Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Wahoo woof! Woof!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!
Hey man, what's that boy?

Ah ho! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Quiet boy, quiet!
Okay

Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!
It's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea
It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much
Ah, it's too much
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much, ah
We all get too much
Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a

Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round, oh oh oh, round round round round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round round round round, oh

Let me take you down, 
'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, 
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, 
'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, 
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down, 
'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, 
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a "no", I mean, a "yes", but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down, 
'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, 
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you traveled very far?
Far as the eye can see
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do

Baby, you're a rich man, too
Oh, baby, you're a rich man

Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Joan was quizzical;
Studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
(Do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
(Do-do-do-do)
P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one,"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, 
Screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
(Do-do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oa
(Do-do-do-do-do)
(Silver hammer man)
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you (Wooo!)
Don't ever leave me alone
When you told me, you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me, that you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

(Oh! Believe me, darling)
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves (Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe (Happy and they’re safe)
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow 
lorry
slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes "The News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hey!) Great!
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight

Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah

Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "let it be"
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

My baby said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said "you've got the wrong location"
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

Oh, Danny boy, the old savanna calling
Originally performed by The Beatles
The long and winding road
That lead to your door
Will never disappear
I've see that road before
It's always leads me here -
Leads me to your door
The while and windy night
That a rain washed a way
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way
Many time I've been along
And many time I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting you
Lead me to your door
(Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members)
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you
(Bop, bop cat bop)
(Go, Johnny, go)

I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me and that's all you had to do
I feel it now I hope you feel it too
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I'm livin' the blues

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, 
McCartney & John Lennon
]
Well, she was just 17, if you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?
[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, 
McCartney & John Lennon
]
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, 
McCartney & John Lennon
]
Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, 
McCartney & John Lennon
]
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there

But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself
Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets (oh) is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Ooh!
Ooh!
Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, in mama's head it's got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
We all miss you; You miss them?
Yeah!
The Beatles miss you; all the Beatles missed you
Now, junior, behave yourself

And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle

Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again
For I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
What can I do, what can I be
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my life
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there
Then suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you...
Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?
Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
[Verse 3: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & 
Ringo Starr
]
Big man 
(
Yeah
)
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Wahoo woof! Woof!

JoJo war ein Mann
Der immer sehr allein war;
Er wollt' 'raus aus seiner Haut
Jo verliess sein Haus in Tulsa
Arizona
Dort hin
Wo man Gras anbaut
Geh heim
Geh heim
Dort hin
Woher du kamst!
Geh heim
Geh heim
Dort hin
Woher du kamst!
(Mach's gut Jo!)
Geh heim
Geh heim
Geh heim dort hin
Woher du kamst
Geh heim "
Geh heim
Jo!
Sweet Loretta Martin dacht'
Dass sie 'ne Frau wär'
Trotzdem war sie auch ein Mann
Alle Mädchen sagten
Dass sie nun 'mal dran wär';
Doch sie holt' sich
Was sie kann
Geh heim...
Mach's gut
Geh heim...
Uh
Geh heim
Loretta
Deine Familie wartet auf dich
Was sollen deine hochhackigen Schuhe und deine
Tief ausgeschnittene Bluse
Geh doch heim
Loretta!
Geh heim...
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free
Ah
Ah
Ah
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Oooooo
Free

Item #: SCP-2137
Object Class: Keter
Special Containment Procedures: When not being used, SCP-2137 is to be kept within a typical electronic 10-digit metal safe in the Safe Wing of Site 23. All digital and wireless broadcast media must be kept at least one hundred meters away from SCP-2137. Due to SCP-2137's anomalous effect having been determined to have no ranged limit, digital, wireless and broadcast media may be used but should be monitored closely for any appearance of SCP-2137-1 or -2.
Other than the testing and recording of Track 7, SCP-2137 should be considered an inanimate item without agency of its own, and any demands or threats made by SCP-2137-2 should be ignored.
Once a week, 2137 is to be cleaned and all tracks are to be played in succession, with special attention paid to the instance of 2137-1 that replaces track 7.
The names, situations and anecdotes presented in that instance of SCP-2137-1 must then be reported to 2137 Special Committee ("Pac Watch").
On the rare occasion that non-Foundation organizations cannot address the situation presented in an instance of SCP-2137-1, O5-9 has given authorization to activate MTF-339 ("The Suge Knights") to take any and all measures necessary to reach a resolution to the problem. Operational success will be indicated by a new instance of 2137-1.
Personnel who wish to examine or attempt to interact with SCP-2137 must ask Dr. Kivowitz for authorization beforehand, which will then pend O5 clearance.
Description: SCP-2137 is a single compact disc copy of "Me Against The World," a hip-hop album by the artist Tupac Shakur, released in 1995. Physical examination as well as laser testing indicates that the CD was one of the initial release, manufactured and distributed in 1995; conventional testing of the disk itself reveals identical results to a non-anomalous copy of the album. The case and liner notes have been determined to have no anomalous qualities, and the physical makeup and encoding of the disk appear completely normal.
However, upon playing track 7, normally "Heavy In The Game," the listener will encounter an instance of SCP-2137-1. The anomaly takes the form of spontaneously-generated, professionally-produced songs featuring Tupac Shakur in various styles within the hip hop genre. Though each instance of SCP-2137-1 generated is unique, they share certain commonalities in terms of subject matter. The central focus of the song invariably addresses a crime, almost always a murder or series of murders, and then gives necessary anecdotal evidence or information to correctly identify and prosecute the killer, even going so far as to specify prosecutors or recommend vigilante justice.
Though generation of SCP-2137-1 has been determined to have a definite causal nature, the manner in which SCP-2137-1 instances are copied onto SCP-2137 has yet to be ascertained.
SCP-2137-2
The primary voice on the songs, from herein identified as SCP-2137-2, matches cleanly through advanced audio analysis to that of the real Tupac Shakur, who died in 1996, over a year before the recovery of SCP-2137.
However, occasionally, on crimes of a particularly complicated or brutal nature, SCP-2137-2 will be joined by other "performers," either guest-rapping or singing the chorus or bridge. This has included many of Tupac's contemporaries, such as Snoop Doggy Dogg, Nas, No Doubt, Everclear, Weezer and Busta Rhymes, as well as artists from the 2000s including Chris Brown, Katy Perry, Lil Wayne, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, the Ying Yang Twins, Drake, Neon Trees, Jet, Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Eminem, usually at the height of their popularity.
On a few notable occasions involving long-unsolved crimes by still active criminals, there have been guests of a more blatantly anachronistic nature, stand-outs among whom include Phil Harris, the Andrews Sisters, Frank Sinatra, Buddy Holly, The Who, Elvis Presley, Diana Ross, and The Beatles. Heavily anachronistic guests tend to take the role of primary artist, the song performed in their style, with SCP-2137-2 joining as a rap guest.
When contacted, none of these artists had any recollection of recording for, or information regarding, SCP-2137.
The crimes themselves share that they are unsolved, or, in some cases, have escaped detection entirely. The majority of instances of SCP-2137-1 address crimes of private citizens such as serial killers, spree-murders, or career criminals, though occasionally the songs will address larger groups, such as Hamas, ISIS, the IRA, and even in two separate instances the Chaos Insurgency and the Church of the Broken God.
A prototypical example of SCP-2137-1 is included here for reference.

Jeff Riegert out there and still stalkin the night,
Killed his brother and five strangers with the same damn knife,
Now it's not my place to tell you what to do,
But nigga I know what I would do if I were you
He hid the blade in an old barn off the North 111
He already got six dog don't let him make it seven
When the crimes have been addressed and the guilty parties brought to light, either by the legal system or otherwise, SCP-2137-1 is immediately replaced by a new instance. However, the track is easily recorded through conventional means, recorded versions are not subject to change or replacement, and the original can be replayed from the CD endlessly before the killer is found, with no little variation. There are currently nearly one thousand instances of SCP-2137-2 on record.

SCP-2137 was recovered in the home of Avon Lincoln, arrested for the vigilante slaying of Michael Ferris, who was later revealed to have been the Ojai Strangler, responsible for six murders over the summer of 1996.
Avon's insistence that Tupac Shakur spoke to him from beyond the grave and told him he had to take justice into his own hands, because Ferris' position as District Attorney would prevent a fair trial, drew the attention of Foundation agents after the song in question was produced as evidence in court.
Amnestics were administered to all involved, and Lincoln was released back into the general population.
Addendum 1a: The XK Incident:
Initially, researchers experimented with anonymously tipping off local police departments through Foundation plants, which led to the resolution of over ███ cold cases, including the recovery of SCP-██, SCP-████, and SCP-617, though no direct link has been established other than the murders involved.
However, after █ years this use of the SCP was deemed impractical; repeatedly addressing the crimes discussed in 2137's "music" was, in practice, allowing the SCP to dictate the circumstances of its containment, and under the wrong circumstances, opened the Foundation to potential exposure through continuous interaction with law enforcement at all levels across multiple governments.
In response to this, O5-9 ceased addressing the crimes in late 20██.
After two months passed, SCP-2137's behavior radically changed, when, for the first time, an instance of SCP-2137-1 was produced that revealed SCP-2137-2 had an awareness of its containment.

You say you're about security but you ain't the good guys,
You redact and expunge man your silence is lies
You say you're here to protect yet you're letting killers run free
Don't make me show you how rough this thug can be
Well,
You can't contain the king dawg
Homie you do not wanna start this struggle
I suggest you change the tune unless you're looking for trouble
Maybe y'all should lay back and let me do my duty,
Locked in drawer feelin like y'all tryna screw me,
You're steppin all up on my destiny
You might not believe I'm the real Pac
But I'm not just a CD
The decision was made to halt testing entirely, rather than acquiesce.
After one week passed, an instance of SCP-2137-1 appeared spontaneously on the YouTube channel of Los Angeles-based hip hop station , and in the lone hour before it was taken down accrued over █████ views.
"XK Scenario" Incident
The image displayed on the video was a still photograph, apparently authentic though by its nature highly anomalous. The photograph is of Shakur, estimated to be in his early forties,1 wearing the garb of Foundation D-Class Personnel, with his middle fingers raised. The accompanying song, titled "███ █████," focused on SCP-███, revealing its actual location and means by which it could be broken free of current containment procedures, and identified several members of the O5 Council by their first names as it described the function and nature of the Foundation.
In a massive sweeping operation involving the activation of multiple task forces across █ continents all trace of the video was erased, and all █████ viewers were administered Class-A Amnestics. Midway through this operation, an entire album titled "XK Scenario" was released to the iTunes account of Beyonce Knowles. Each song featured SCP-2137-2, as well as a variety of guest artists, and focused on a different Keter class SCP currently in captivity.
Though SCP tracking bots were able to bring "XK Scenario" down after only ███ downloads, complete digital eradication of the individual files has proven difficult. Though no loss of life or property was incurred, the sheer scale of the danger posed by this containment breach prompted a Foundation-wide state of high alert. This prompted an ongoing upgrade to all automatic SCP firewalls, and engendered the reclassification of SCP-2137 from Euclid to Keter.
The breach sparked heated debate as to how to proceed with the containment of (and conceptual understanding regarding) SCP-2137, which came to an end upon the appearance of a new instance of SCP-2137-1. This instance was produced spontaneously through the mouth of SCP-███, which appeared to fall into a trance state during the incident, with the lyrics, in totality, repeatedly written in what was identified as  one hundred and seventeen thousand (117,000) times all over the interior of its containment chamber.

So consider long and hard the hammer I'm swingin'
Cause the next time you open your mouth
It might just be me singin'
The decision was made to resume the former method of testing, involving the embedded informants used to relay SCP-2137's evidence and information, while continuing to study the method by which SCP-2137 transmits its broadcasts, in an effort to truly contain it completely. SCP-2137-2 resumed its previous behavioral pattern, SCP-2137-1s focusing on crimes until their killers are located by conventional law enforcement, with the exception of one final track — at this time, its last recorded direct interaction with the Foundation.

Aw my niggas,
I knew you'd come around
Step in the ring with a god and you're gonna get clowned
But let's be real homie there was no need to fight it
There's a grander design, and I betcha gonna like it
You got a lot of gray
and that keeps you up at night
but sometimes
things really are just black and white
Investigation into any kind of link or pattern between the crimes SCP-2137 solves is ongoing, as is interest to why it doesn't use its agency to pursue the criminals in question rather than working through proxies.
Footnotes
1. At the time of his murder in 1996, Shakur was twenty-five years old.
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby, and I love her so
And every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
When I call her on the telephone
She says, "Baby, I'm all alone"
Before the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door
Every evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
"Hey baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so

Will light our way to love

I, I saw a girl in my dreams
And so it seems that I will love her
Oh you, you are that girl in my dreams
And so it seems that I will love you
And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do
And I
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
Oh I knew when you first said hello
That's how I know that I will love you
Hello little girl
Hello little girl
Hello little girl
When I see you everyday
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When you're passing on your way
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I see you passing by
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I try to catch your eye
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"
I send you flowers but you don't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I often wonder what you're thinking of
I hope it's me and love love love
So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, "Mm you're my little girl"
It's not the first time that it's happened to me
It's been a long lonely time
And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind
So I hope there'll come a day
When you say, "Mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm"
You're my little girl, oh yeah
You're my little girl

And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? (Ooh)
When I saw her standing there?
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woo)

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight

Now, I'll never dance with another (Woo)
Since I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"

And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow 
lorry
slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine

Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today

Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (

I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (

Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle

Dance like a spinning top

No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky

You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
When I see you, I just don't know what to say
I like to be with you every hour of the day
So if you want me just like I need you
You know what to do
I watched you walking by, and you looked alone
I hope that you won't mind if I walk you back home
And if you want me just like I need you
You know what to do
Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only
I'll call on you if I'm lonely too
Understand I'll stay with you every day
Make you love me more in every way
So if you want me just like I want you
You know what to do
Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only
I'll call on you if I'm lonely too
Understand I'll stay with you every day
Make you love me more in every way
So if you want me just like I want you
You know what to do
This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
If I were you, I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no reply
Mr. Moonlight
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine
I think you're fine
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight, come again please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I'll pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight
And the night you don't come my way
Oh, I'll pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight, come again please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
Oh I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight
You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
But I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
You better leave my kitten all alone
This dog is going to get you
If you don't leave her alone
Well, Mister Dog, I'm going to hit you
On the top of your head
That child is going to miss you
You're going to wish that you were dead
If you don't leave my kitten all alone
Well I told you big fat bulldog
You better leave her alone
Alright

Oh, so long
Bye, bye, baby I'm gone
Yeah, I said
Bye, bye, baby, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye
All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone
It's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
Yes it's real love, it's real
It's real love, it's real
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine, and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot
A friend says that a love is never true
But you know this can't apply to you
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
And when she says she loves you, that means a lot
Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide what you feel
When it's real?
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
But you know that your love is all you've got
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
One, two, three, four!

When I DJ, I turn the bass up the tick-o
The girls with the big big booties
I'm straight chillin', coolin' out with cuties (hey!)
21 and over, ain't messin' wit juvies
Girls always talkin' 'bout "I ain't no groupie!"
I ain't stupie, I know what the truth be
You was up chillin' with Yeezy last week
You nasty; admit it, you nasty
Tryin' to act classy, askin' for a glass... please
Grab a glass and get wet
Asked for some bubble so I gave her Moet
I said I don't want trouble, but she said won't get
Busy 'cause she dizzy, so I said let's jet

PART 2 :
Can't rock it like this
I'm the new enig-matic, black acrobatic
Alien about to invade, galactic
Ladies climaxin', off of my axin'
Filipino comin' to the US, mashin'
Laser, flashin', big ghetto blastin'
Vodka, water, down for some action
Check it out now, the funk soul brother
And right about now, you know I'm on that other
Shit, but you can't rock it like me though
Niggas say I'm dope, white girls say I'm neat-o
I rock wave forms, ain't fuckin' with no needle
Music revolution like underground Beatles
Yeah... you can't rock it like us
Bitch, you need to shut the fuck up!
I'm on a mission, I'm on a mission
Start the ignition
Let's blow it up like nitroglycerine
It's the new definition, of club demolition
Check the new composition
Let's shoot 'em down with the killer ammunition
I got a proposition
Stop, listen
'Cause this beat bangs
A banger, knock 'em out to submission
I got an intuition
Tonight's gonna be a good good exhibition
Hope you don't have no heart condition
Think you can rock it like this, you're wishing
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this
You can't rock it like this

On the road to Rishikesh
I was dreaming more or less
And the dream I had was true
Yes, the dream I had was true
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just child of nature
I'm one of nature's children
Sunlight shining in your eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes, my thoughts return to home
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one nature's children
Underneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind that never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soul
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature's children
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning
But it's not always going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving
It has not always been this grey
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So I must be on my way
And face another day
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this grey
She looks as an African Queen
She eating twelve chapattis and cream
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
She coming from out of Bahran
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
She like to be married with Yetti
He grooving such cookie spaghetti
She jumping as Mexican bean
To make that her body morphine
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
She catch Patagonian pancake
With that one and gin party makes
She having always good contact
She making with Apple and contract
[Chorus
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
All together now
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame
Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame
Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame
Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame
She looks as an African Queen
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
All together now
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame
Let's hear it
Before we get taken away-
Red light
Demo take one
If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it, any time
I can give it
But you better hurry because it may not last
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?
If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you better hurry because it's going fast
If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it, any time
I can give it
But you better hurry because it may not last
Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?
Sonny, if you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast
Woo, fool and his money
Sonny, if you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast

Running to and fro, hard
Working at the mail
Never fail
Get the mail
Yeah, some rotten deal
Ow!
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to invite them again
Say me
Talking to me
Tryin' to run me up a creek
She used to buy one
Try to pay me again next week
Ow!
Long-haired, good-looking
Trying to get me hooked
Or me to marry
Settle down
Get the horn by the bull
Ow!
Mediocre money
Being fighting in the hall
Army bunk, army go
Army chow, army cook
Ow!
Same thing every day
Getting up, going to school
No need to make complaining
My objection's overruled
Ow!
Working in the filling station
Too many tires
Wipe the windows
Check the tire
Check the oil and all the gas
Ow!
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Don't want your moderation, get away, leave me
We've been friends for oh so long
I let you share what's mine
When you mess with the girl I love
It's time to draw the line
Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
I don't mind if you lend my clothes
But you will be in touch
There is something that you get straight
There's one thing you don't touch
Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine
Keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands (Keep your hands) off my baby
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine
(Keep your hands) Whoa, keep your hands off my baby
She's mine (Keep your hands off my baby)
You better watch yourself now
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go
They were right I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way hey
I saw her standing on the corner (Yip yip boom)
A yellow ribbon in her hair (Yip yip boom)
I couldn't stop myself from calling
Well look a-there, look a-there
Wow look a-there, well look a-there
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
I took one look and I was fractured (Yip yip boom)
I tried to walk but I was lame (Yip yip boom)
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
Well what's your name, what's your name
Well what's your name, well what's your name
Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
A crazy stop, she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!
Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered (Yip yip boom)
I saw the rising of the sun (Yip yip boom)
And all along my heart was falling
While you're the one, you're the one
While you're the one, ah you're the one
Young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Well, if your hands start a-clapping
And your fingers start a-popping
And your feet start a-moving around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?
Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing
And chills coming up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?
I'm sure to fall
Fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet
And so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life
Some other guy now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
Some other guy now, has taken away my sweet desire, oh now
Some other guy now, I just don't want to hold my hand, oh now
I'm the lonely one, as lonely as I can feel all right
Some other guy now, is sipping up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now

If it takes me all night and day
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride
Well you take your car along
And you park it outside
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am
Well every time you're going to drive
You find the joint is jammed
Well if you want to hear some music
Like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot
Don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overcome you
Because they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd
Well you can dance

Because you dance so good
Don't let him
Steal your heart away

Love is the ceiling feeling are reeling free as the air
Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but are we who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love
Whoever knew that we too could be free as we fancied
Fancy is free but we are who are bound to each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
Deep down in Louisiana
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!
He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!
Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

Oh baby baby baby

I can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
How must I forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes?
You've broken my heart
Gonna do it again
And I can't forget
The spell that I'm in
Can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
I'm a-trying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes
I found it out, what love is all about
And every day, it sure lets out
I see my baby, I get weak in the knees
'Cause nothin's shakin' but the leaves on the tree
My papi told me there'd be times like these
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang and go to rockin' Joe's
The cats are something on the heels and toes
I grab my baby, tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be such a dog-gone tease?
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
For goodness sake

Because I feel so good
When you call me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Ooh mercy, I'm rock gone puppy
And I'm happy

Your touch sewed me
Like an electric wire
Never thought of make love
It don't take much looking
To see what I've got
But it shows, yes it shows
Come on honey Bonnie

Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot dang gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over

Tried to tell you
How I'm cooking inside

Well you call me your baby
When you hold in my hand
But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand
Well you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand
But the way you deceive me
I just don't understand
Well you know that I love you
More than anyone can
But a one-sided love
I just don't understand
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Because I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
I'm gonna search this town
From door to door
Love I crave
I can't find no more
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever do in my life
I wanna find that little woman
Make her my wife
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tom-boy
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to to be
As sweet as you are
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So how can I get tired of you
A lots of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So please don't ever change
Now don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to to be
As sweet as you are
Please don't ever change
Don't you ever change
Please don't ever change
Don't you ever change (fade out)

If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more, it's true
Yes it is
Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah
"Please don't wear red tonight"
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true

If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is

(Help!) I need somebody
(Help!) Not just anybody
(Help!) You know I need someone
(Help!)
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Help me? Help me? Ooh

I'm down (I'm really down)
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
(How can you laugh) When you know I'm down?

You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"

Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
Got a good reason

Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night
We can work it out
We can work it out
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out

Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book?
It took me years to write, will you take a look?
It's based on a novel by a man named Lear
And I need a job, so I want to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer!
It's a dirty story of a dirty man
And his clinging wife doesn't understand
His son is working for the Daily Mail
It's a steady job, but he wants to be a paperback writer
Paperback writer!

It's a thousand pages, give or take a few (Frère)
I'll be writing more in a week or two (Jacques)
I could make it longer if you like the style (Frère)
I can change it 'round and I want to be a paperback writer (Jacques)
Paperback writer!
If you really like it, you can have the rights (Frère)
It could make a million for you overnight (Jacques)
If you must return it, you can send it here (Frère)
But I need a break, and I want to be a paperback writer (Jacques)

If the rain comes
They run and hide their heads

They slip into the shade

When the sun shines (Sun shines)

That when it rains and shines

Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Full steam ahead Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us (Everyone of us) has all we need (Has all we need)
Sky of blue (Sky of blue) and sea of green (Sea of green)
In our yellow (In our yellow) submarine (Submarine, ha-ha!)
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane
Let me take you down, 
'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, 
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, 
'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, 
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down, 
'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, 
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a "no", I mean, a "yes", but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down, 
'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, 
and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
Nothing you can make that can't be made

Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy

See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob
Mister City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
Yellow-matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain
I am the egg man (now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob (good pity)
G'goo goo g'joob
Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying
Semolina pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob, g'goo
Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob! Joob! Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob!
Joob! Joob!
Umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper
Everybody's got one, everybody's got one
“Villain, take my Purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party. Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable Villain; as duteous to the Vices of thy Mistress as badness would desire.”
“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you.”
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
See how they run
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Without going out of my door
I can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing
Aah!
You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We all want to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright!
JoJo war ein Mann
Der immer sehr allein war;
Er wollt' 'raus aus seiner Haut
Jo verliess sein Haus in Tulsa
Arizona
Dort hin
Wo man Gras anbaut
Geh heim
Geh heim
Dort hin
Woher du kamst!
Geh heim
Geh heim
Dort hin
Woher du kamst!
(Mach's gut Jo!)
Geh heim
Geh heim
Geh heim dort hin
Woher du kamst
Geh heim "
Geh heim
Jo!
Sweet Loretta Martin dacht'
Dass sie 'ne Frau wär'
Trotzdem war sie auch ein Mann
Alle Mädchen sagten
Dass sie nun 'mal dran wär';
Doch sie holt' sich
Was sie kann
Geh heim...
Mach's gut
Geh heim...
Uh
Geh heim
Loretta
Deine Familie wartet auf dich
Was sollen deine hochhackigen Schuhe und deine
Tief ausgeschnittene Bluse
Geh doch heim
Loretta!
Geh heim...
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Nobody ever loved me like she does
Oh, she does
Yeah, she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Oh, she do me
Yes, she does
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down
I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past (Seeking past)
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down
And from the first time that she really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Oh, she done me
She done me good
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, don't let me let down
Can you dig it? Don't let me down
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac
 said, 
"You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
"You can make it O.K
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain"
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Drove from Paris to the 
Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, "Say what you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
"Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you
But your soul - think!"
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"
Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly

He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please
Shoot me

He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola

Come together, right now
Over me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Verse 3
He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease
Come together, right now
Over me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Right!
Come, come, come, come
He roller-coaster, he got early warnin'
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, "One and one and one is three."

Wenn ich mich 'mal дusserst elend fьhle
Kommt Maria her zu mir
Sie spricht weise Worte: "Du wirst seh'n!"
Und dann in schweren Stunden
Steht sie immer noch ganz nah bei mir
Flьstert weise Worte: "Du wirst seh'n!"
Du wirst seh'n, du wirst seh'n, du wirst seh'n, du wirst seh'n!
Flьstert weise Worte:
Du wirst seh'n!
Wenn alle
Die nicht weiter wissen
Einig lebten auf der Welt
Gдb es eine Antwort
Du wirst seh'n!
Und wenn sie auch getrennt sind
Gibt es noch 'ne Chance
Die sie auch seh'n
Da gibt's eine Antwort
Du wirst seh'n!
Du wirst seh'n...
Solo
Du wirst seh'n...
Und ist die Nacht auch dunkel
Gibt es noch ein Licht
Das zu mir strahlt
Strahlt bis frьh am morgen
Du wirst seh'n
Ich wach auf bei dem Klang von Musik
Und Maria kommt zu mir
Sie spricht weise Worte: "Du wirst seh'n!"
Du wirst seh'n...Es gibt eine Antwort, du wirst seh'n!
