       " 'item  scp2137 object class keter special containment procedures when not being used scp2137 is to be kept within a typical electronic 10digit metal safe in the safe wing of site 23 all digital and wireless broadcast media must be kept at least one hundred meters away from scp2137 due to scp2137s anomalous effect having been determined to have no ranged limit digital wireless and broadcast media may be used but should be monitored closely for any appearance of scp21371 or 2 other than the testing and recording of track 7 scp2137 should be considered an inanimate item without agency of its own and any demands or threats made by scp21372 should be ignored once a week 2137 is to be cleaned and all tracks are to be played in succession with special attention paid to the instance of 21371 that replaces track 7 the names situations and anecdotes presented in that instance of scp21371 must then be reported to 2137 special committee  on the rare occasion that nonfoundation organizations cannot address the situation presented in an instance of scp21371 o59 has given authorization to activate mtf339 to take any and all measures necessary to reach a resolution to the problem operational success will be indicated by a new instance of 21371 personnel who wish to examine or attempt to interact with scp2137 must ask dr kivowitz for authorization beforehand which will then pend o5 clearance description scp2137 is a single compact disc copy of me against the world a hiphop album by the artist tupac shakur released in 1995 physical examination as well as laser testing indicates that the cd was one of the initial release manufactured and distributed in 1995 conventional testing of the disk itself reveals identical results to a nonanomalous copy of the album the case and liner notes have been determined to have no anomalous qualities and the physical makeup and encoding of the disk appear completely normal however upon playing track 7 normally heavy in the game the listener will encounter an instance of scp21371 the anomaly takes the form of spontaneouslygenerated professionallyproduced songs featuring tupac shakur in various styles within the hip hop genre though each instance of scp21371 generated is unique they share certain commonalities in terms of subject matter the central focus of the song invariably addresses a crime almost always a murder or series of murders and then gives necessary anecdotal evidence or information to correctly identify and prosecute the killer even going so far as to specify prosecutors or recommend vigilante justice though generation of scp21371 has been determined to have a definite causal nature the manner in which scp21371 instances are copied onto scp2137 has yet to be ascertained scp21372 the primary voice on the songs from herein identified as scp21372 matches cleanly through advanced audio analysis to that of the real tupac shakur who died in 1996 over a year before the recovery of scp2137 however occasionally on crimes of a particularly complicated or brutal nature scp21372 will be joined by other performers either guestrapping or singing the chorus or bridge this has included many of tupacs contemporaries such as snoop doggy dogg nas no doubt everclear weezer and busta rhymes as well as artists from the 2000s including chris brown katy perry lil wayne lady gaga rihanna the ying yang twins drake neon trees jet jayz kanye west and eminem usually at the height of their popularity on a few notable occasions involving longunsolved crimes by still active criminals there have been guests of a more blatantly anachronistic nature standouts among whom include phil harris the andrews sisters frank sinatra buddy holly the who elvis presley diana ross and the beatles heavily anachronistic guests tend to take the role of primary artist the song performed in their style with scp21372 joining as a rap guest when contacted none of these artists had any recollection of recording for or information regarding scp2137 the crimes themselves share that they are unsolved or in some cases have escaped detection entirely the majority of instances of scp21371 address crimes of private citizens such as serial killers spreemurders or career criminals though occasionally the songs will address larger groups such as hamas isis the ira and even in two separate instances the chaos insurgency and the church of the broken god a prototypical example of scp21371 is included here for reference  hide jeff riegert out there and still stalkin the night killed his brother and five strangers with the same damn knife now its not my place to tell you what to do but nigga i know what i would do if i were you he hid the blade in an old barn off the north 111 he already got six dog dont let him make it seven when the crimes have been addressed and the guilty parties brought to light either by the legal system or otherwise scp21371 is immediately replaced by a new instance however the track is easily recorded through conventional means recorded versions are not subject to change or replacement and the original can be replayed from the cd endlessly before the killer is found with no little variation there are currently nearly one thousand instances of scp21372 on record  hide scp2137 was recovered in the home of avon lincoln arrested for the vigilante slaying of michael ferris who was later revealed to have been the ojai strangler responsible for six murders over the summer of 1996 avons insistence that tupac shakur spoke to him from beyond the grave and told him he had to take justice into his own hands because ferris position as district attorney would prevent a fair trial drew the attention of foundation agents after the song in question was produced as evidence in court amnestics were administered to all involved and lincoln was released back into the general population addendum 1a the xk incident initially researchers experimented with anonymously tipping off local police departments through foundation plants which led to the resolution of over ███ cold cases including the recovery of scp██ scp████ and scp617 though no direct link has been established other than the murders involved however after █ years this use of the scp was deemed impractical repeatedly addressing the crimes discussed in 2137s music was in practice allowing the scp to dictate the circumstances of its containment and under the wrong circumstances opened the foundation to potential exposure through continuous interaction with law enforcement at all levels across multiple governments in response to this o59 ceased addressing the crimes in late 20██ after two months passed scp2137s behavior radically changed when for the first time an instance of scp21371 was produced that revealed scp21372 had an awareness of its containment  hide you say youre about security but you aint the good guys you redact and expunge man your silence is lies you say youre here to protect yet youre letting killers run free dont make me show you how rough this thug can be well you cant contain the king dawg homie you do not wanna start this struggle i suggest you change the tune unless youre looking for trouble maybe yall should lay back and let me do my duty locked in drawer feelin like yall tryna screw me youre steppin all up on my destiny you might not believe im the real pac but im not just a cd the decision was made to halt testing entirely rather than acquiesce after one week passed an instance of scp21371 appeared spontaneously on the youtube channel of los angelesbased hip hop station  and in the lone hour before it was taken down accrued over █████ views xk scenario incident the image displayed on the video was a still photograph apparently authentic though by its nature highly anomalous the photograph is of shakur estimated to be in his early forties1 wearing the garb of foundation dclass personnel with his middle fingers raised the accompanying song titled ███ █████ focused on scp███ revealing its actual location and means by which it could be broken free of current containment procedures and identified several members of the o5 council by their first names as it described the function and nature of the foundation in a massive sweeping operation involving the activation of multiple task forces across █ continents all trace of the video was erased and all █████ viewers were administered classa amnestics midway through this operation an entire album titled xk scenario was released to the itunes account of beyonce knowles each song featured scp21372 as well as a variety of guest artists and focused on a different keter class scp currently in captivity though scp tracking bots were able to bring xk scenario down after only ███ downloads complete digital eradication of the individual files has proven difficult though no loss of life or property was incurred the sheer scale of the danger posed by this containment breach prompted a foundationwide state of high alert this prompted an ongoing upgrade to all automatic scp firewalls and engendered the reclassification of scp2137 from euclid to keter the breach sparked heated debate as to how to proceed with the containment of scp2137 which came to an end upon the appearance of a new instance of scp21371 this instance was produced spontaneously through the mouth of scp███ which appeared to fall into a trance state during the incident with the lyrics in totality repeatedly written in what was identified as one hundred and seventeen thousand times all over the interior of its containment chamber  hide help me catch my killers and ill let you have yours trust me you nerds do not want a war what if i told you i ████ ████

relay scp2137s evidence and information while continuing to study the method by which scp2137 transmits its broadcasts in an effort to truly contain it completely scp21372 resumed its previous
